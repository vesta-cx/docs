Permissions is a table containing information on `who` can do `what`, `where`. More specifically, it defines which `subject`, can perform which `action`s on which `object`.

| Field          |     | Description                   |
| -------------- | --- | ----------------------------- |
| `id`           |     | Identifier for the permission |
| `subject_type` |     |                               |
