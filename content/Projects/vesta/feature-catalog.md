## Pricing Philosophy & Margins

**Target margin:** 60-70% for sustainable business (covers payroll, infrastructure, support, growth).

**Why these margins?**

- **High COO features** (e.g., advanced analytics at $6 COO): Lower margin (60%) because infra is expensive; discount curve helps offset
- **Low COO features** (e.g., profiles at $1 COO): High margin (N/A for free, or 70%+ for paid) because they have low operational cost
- **Support & APIs**: 70-85% margin (human effort but high value)

**How discount curve uses this:**

- When user adds multiple features, discount asymptotes toward average COO
- User never pays less than COO (preserves minimum margin)
- Discount curve targets 40-50% discount at high feature adoption

## Updates & Notes

**Last updated:** Feb 2026

**Future considerations:**

- Monitor real-world COO; adjust as we learn what actually costs to run
- Gather user feedback on pricing (too expensive? too cheap?)
- A/B test pricing on different cohorts
- Add new features; maintain 60-70% margin target
